This pack uses vanilla shaders, which are likely incompatible with Optifine or any other mod that affects client side rendering.

For more information on what's included, check out [changelog.txt](changelog.txt)

### If you don't want the entire pack, here are my own separate modules:

## [RealMaps](RealMaps.zip)
More realistic map colors using a core shader.
Map icons are also tweaked a bit.
